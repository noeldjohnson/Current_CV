	Abstract = {State capacity has become one of the most discussed concepts in development economics and political economy. In this survey we argue that the study of economic history provides vital insights into the process through which modern states have acquired `state capacity'. By evaluating the process of state building across a range of different countries in Europe and Asia, we are able to `decompress' the relationship between state capacity and economic growth. Our analysis emphasizes the variegated nature of the state building process. We focus on recent research that helps to elucidate the mechanisms that relate state capacity to economic growth.},

We first show that partisan policy outcomes do exist across U.S. states, with Republicans cutting taxes and spending and Democrats raising them. We then demonstrate that these partisan policy outcomes are moderated in states with no-carry restrictions on public deficits. Lastly, we test whether unified Republican or Democratic state governments regulate more when constrained by no-carry restrictions. We find no-carry laws restrict partisan fiscal outcomes but tend to lead to more partisan regulatory outcomes.},

However, some theory suggests corruption might have a positive impact in places with dysfunctional political institutions. This paper investigates whether the corruption-growth link is conditional on the extent of government involvement across U.S. states. Even though no state approaches the level of government intervention found in many developing countries, we still find evidence that corruption's harmful effects on growth are smaller when regulation is greater.},

@article{AndersonEtAl13,
	Abstract = {What factors caused the persecution of minorities in medieval and early modern Europe? We build a model that predicts that minority communities were more likely to be expropriated in the wake of negative income shocks. We then use panel data consisting of 785 city-level expulsions of Jews from 933 European cities between 1100 and 1800 to test the implications of the model. We use the variation in city-level temperature to test whether expulsions were associated with colder growing seasons. We find that a one standard deviation decrease in average growing season temperature in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was associated with a one to two percentage point increase in the likelihood that a Jewish community would be expelled. Drawing on our model and on additional historical evidence we argue that the rise of state capacity was one reason why this relationship between negative income shocks and expulsions weakened after 1600.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the rise of the fiscal state in the early modern period and its impact on legal capacity. To measure legal capacity, we establish that witchcraft trials were more likely to take place where the central state had weak legal insti- tutions. Combining data on the geographic distribution of witchcraft trials with unique panel data on tax receipts across 21 French regions, we find that the rise of the tax state can account for much of the decline in witch trials during this period. Further historical evidence supports our hypothesis that higher taxes led to better legal institutions.},

	Abstract = {How did modern and centralized fiscal institutions emerge? We develop a model that explains (i) why pre-industrial states relied on private individuals to collect taxes; (ii) why after 1600 both England and France moved from competitive methods for collecting revenues to allocating the right to collect taxes to a small group of financiers---a intermediate institution that we call cabal tax farming---and (iii) why this centralization led to investments in fiscal capacity and increased fiscal standardization. We provide detailed historical evidence that supports our prediction that rulers abandoned the competitive allocation of tax rights in favor of cabal tax farming in order to gain access to inside credit and that this transition was accompanied by investments in standardization. Finally (iv) we show why this intermediate institution proved to be self-undermining in England where it was quickly replaced by direct collection, but lasted in France until the French Revolution.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between the historical process of legal centralization and increased religious toleration by the state. We develop a model in which legal centralization leads to the criminalization of the religious beliefs of a large proportion of the population. This process initially leads to increased persecution, but, because these persecutions are costly, it eventually causes the state to broaden the standards of orthodox belief and move toward religious toleration. We compare the results of the model with historical evidence drawn from two important cases in which religious diversity and state centralization collided in France: the Albigensian crusades of the thirteenth century and the rise of Protestant belief in the sixteenth century. Both instances sup- port our central claim that the secularization of western European state institutions during the early-modern period was driven by the costs of imposing a common set of legal standards on religiously diverse populations.},

@article{KletzerWright00,
	Abstract = {Borrowing and lending between sovereign parties is modeled as intertemporal barter that smoothes the consumption of a risk-averse party subject to endowment shocks. The surplus anticipated in the relationship offers sufficient incentive for cooperation by all parties, including any other competitive agents who are potential lenders to the sovereign. The sole punishments consist of renegotiation-proof changes in the path of future payments. We show that intertemporal trade can be sustained in the absence of any exogenous enforcement of lending relationships whatsoever. That is, borrowing and lending are possible under anarchy, and are supported by punishments that consist of cheating any cheater. Long-term implicit relationships may be fulfilled as the continual renegotiation of simple incomplete short-term loans. The analysis suggests that the crucial role of the explicit loan contract is the identification of the relationship and the parties involved.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

	Abstract = { The authors present a dynamic model of international lending in whi ch borrowers cannot commit to future repayments and debtors can sometime s successfully negotiate partial defaults or \&quot;rescheduling agreements.\&quot; All parties in a debt rescheduling negotiation realize that today's rescheduling agreement may itself have to be renegotiated in the future. The authors' bargaining-theoretic approach allows them to handle the effects of uncertainty on sovereign debt contracts in a much more satisfactory way than in earlier analyses. The framework is readily extended to analyze the conflicting interests of different lenders, and of banks and creditor-country taxpayers. Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.},

	Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of favorable economic conditions, in particular developed capitalism, upon the state making process in the seventeenth-century United Provinces and eighteenth-century Great Britain. The most crucial aspect of state making, the creation of a standing army, coincided with an enormous amount of surplus production and trade, a dynamic economic growth, and the accumulation of capital. These conditions allowed the state to impose manifold excises, that were used above all to pay for the debt charges incurred from the ever growing number of public loans, which insured in turn a dose relationship with the dominant financial elites. Being thus allowed a most effective extractive capacity, avoiding at the same time the dangers of civil disturbances, these states were able to extend themselves as early modern imperial states.},

	Abstract = {England is, according to both Marx and Weber, the classic ground of modern rational capitalism. Yet England's political history and institutions strikingly deviate from what Weberian or Marxist ideal-types of capitalist development might lead us to expect. This article argues that these deviations are important in explaining why England became the home of capitalism in the first place. Particular stress is put upon the earliness of England's formation as a national state, or the continuites of its major legal and political institutions, and what are often seen as their amateurish "irrationalities" in molding, over the very longue dur{\'e}e, a civil society in which capitalist economy was possible. If so, the pertinence of Marxist and Weberian ideal-types to a historical sociology of capitalism, whether in England or elsewhere, needs very seriously to be reconsidered.},

	Abstract = {This article aims to show that taxation in the early and mid-sixteenth century had a deleterious effect on the English economy, in particular through the taxation of mercantile wealth. While tax rates were modest by modern standards, the article shows how they were levied on capital and not on income, that their effect was cumulative ('compound taxation'), and that they impacted on the small part of the merchant's wealth held in realizable form (as opposed to stock or trade credits). Evidence is produced from Coventry and from Babergh hundred (Suffolk) to show that individuals' assessments could be halved between 1522 and 1525 in line with predictions of the effects of 'compound taxation', but that the impact of taxation was not even across the community.},

@article{Ma03,
	Abstract = {The last two decades of the 20th century witnessed a tide of privatization of public services under the banner of New Public Management (NPM). Interestingly, some proponents and opponents of NPM assume that NPM reform is something genuinely new. Drawing from administrative history during the early modern period (1500-1800), this paper argues that NPM is not genuinely new; instead, there were uncelebrated forerunners in the early modern period. From a detailed analysis of tax farming in the early modern period, this paper offers three findings that are useful for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of NPM reform, especially its privatization strategy. They are: 1. although tax farming was used in early times for its relative efficiency, it was not a cost-free mechanism and its short-term efficiency would have detrimental long-term results in revenue generation and financial management; 2. because of privatization, the public interest might be undermined by private profits; and 3. with privatization, citizens would be subject to the greed of tax farmers. These lessons have implications for contemporary NPM reform, especially its privatization strategy, leading to a warning that what had occurred under the tax farming system may happen with the recent privatization of public services.},

It highlights some likenesses as well as differences between England and other such polities both near and far as Scotland, Denmark, France and Japan. In accounting for English distinctiveness, more emphasis is put on geography, climate and ethos than on more conventional political and economic factors. It presents some of the salient features of the British state, which makes it so peculiar. A great measure of linguistic unity, or in part of involuntary uniformity, is another feature of English distinctiveness. The southern-midland variant of "middle English" established dominance from the 14th century, and out of this modern English has developed. It is, however, striking that in the cases of overseas expansion and scientific advance England was behind other parts of Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries but by the 17th century had moved t},

The Glorious Revolution s political settlement appears to have reduced the risk premium on sovereign debt; but it seems to have raised, not lowered, rates on private debt. Two explanations for these higher private rates are suggested. During the war years 1690 1697, the government s improved capacity to borrow seems to have crowded out private borrowing. After peace was restored and the government s borrowing retrenched, the new political regime seems to have stimulated demand for loanable funds.},

I estimated a vector autoregression for data on fertility, mortality and real wages over the period 1541 1840 applying a well-known identification strategy broadly used in macroeconomics. The results show that endogenous adjustment of population to real wages functioned as Malthus assumed only until the seventeenth century: positive checks disappeared during the seventeenth century and preventive checks disappeared before 1740. This implies that the endogenous adjustment of population levels to changes in real wages one of the cornerstones of the Malthusian model did not work during an important part of the period usually considered within the Malthusian regime .},

	Abstract = {Unlike most cross-country growth analyses, we focus on turning points in growth performance. We look for instances of rapid acceleration in economic growth that are sustained for at least eight years and identify more than 80 such episodes since the 1950s. Growth accelerations tend to be correlated with increases in investment and trade, and with real exchange rate depreciations. Political-regime changes are statistically significant predictors of growth accelerations. External shocks tend to produce growth accelerations that eventually fizzle out, while economic reform is a statistically significant predictor of growth accelerations that are sustained. Growth accelerations tend to be highly upredictable: the vast majority of growth accelerations are unrelated to standard determinants and most instances of economic reform do not produce growth accelerations.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

	Abstract = {The so-called "Commercial Revolution" of the seventeenth century is thought to have been caused by the geographical discoveries of the 1500's which opened markets in the New World and shifted locational advantage to the European North Atlantic. This paper examines the hypothesis that the rise of Holland and England and the decline of the Mediterranean were the result of competitive victories in the old European markets, not new-found opportunities in the West. By employing a pattern of competitive tactics in industry, best analyzed in terms of an imperfect competition model, the Northern competitors ousted traditional suppliers from the old market area and enjoyed a period of formative industrial growth long before colonial markets became important sources of demand.},

@techreport{Cantoni12,
	Abstract = {We present new data documenting medieval Europe's "Commercial Revolution'' using information on the establishment of markets in Germany. We use these data to test whether medieval universities played a causal role in expanding economic activity, examining the foundation of Germany's first universities after 1386 following the Papal Schism. We find that the trend rate of market establishment breaks upward in 1386 and that this break is greatest where the distance to a university shrank most. There is no differential pre-1386 trend associated with the reduction in distance to a university, and there is no break in trend in 1386 where university proximity did not change. These results are not affected by excluding cities close to universities or cities belonging to territories that included universities. Universities provided training in newly-rediscovered Roman and Canon law; students with legal training served in positions that reduced the uncertainty of trade in medieval Europe. We argue that training in the law, and the consequent development of legal and administrative institutions, was an important channel linking universities and greater economic activity.},

@techreport{Voth11b,
	Abstract = {In 1500, Europe was composed of hundreds of statelets and principalities, with weak central authority, no monopoly over the legitimate use of violence, and multiple, overlapping levels of jurisdiction. By 1800, Europe had consolidated into a handful of powerful, centralized nation states. We build a model that simultaneously explains both the emergence of capable states and growing divergence between European powers. In our model, the impact of war on the European state system depends on: i) the importance of money for determining the war outcome (which stands for the cost of war), and ii) a country's initial level of domestic political fragmentation. We emphasize the role of the 'Military Revolution', which raised the cost of war. Initially, this caused more internally cohesive states to invest more in state capacity, while other (more divided) states rationally dropped out of the competition. This mechanism leads to both increasing divergence between European states, and greater average investments in state building on the continent overall.},

He obtained a commanding position within the African company in 1628 and did much to secure the company's reconstitution on a sounder basis in 1631. From 1631 until 1644 Crispe was the driving force behind the trade and, in particular, directed and largely financed the successful English entry into the gold trade of the Gold Coast, where permanent English factories with resident traders were established for the first time and a fort was started at Kormantin. After the Restoration he tried to regain his former position, but was unsuccessful, though his membership of the Company of Adventurers did give him some influence on the trade. Other members of the family were also involved in the African trade, sometimes in a significant way, over the same period.},

@article{Scott03,
	Abstract = {During the eighteenth century Protestantism was not an unambiguous glue of Anglo‐Scottish integration. At the Covenanting end of Scots presbyterianism, notably among the ranks of the Cameronians and the Seceders, an alternative conception of Britishness prevailed which took its rise from the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. Covenanting unionism was predicated on the establishment of presbyterian church government across the British Isles under the auspices of Covenanted monarchy. The later Covenanters of the eighteenth century espoused a form of unionism which rejected the Erastian and pluralist compromises of the actual union of 1707 and a form of militant Whiggism which not only included a strain of resistance theory out of step with the moderation of mainstream Whiggery, but also fell short, in varying degrees, of unqualified loyalty to the Hanoverian monarchy. Indeed, the Cameronians argued that uncovenanted Hanoverians had no better title to rule than the exiled Stuarts. The Covenanting tradition, however, was no monolith, and the question of allegiance led to serious political disputes between Cameronians and Seceders. Covenanting disenchantment with the Anglican inflections of the British constitution persisted into the 1790s when Scottish criticisms of the government were framed as much by Covenanting as by Jacobin principles.},

@article{Kiser94b,
	Abstract = {We use agency theory to analyze the development of the tax collection system in Prussia between 1640 and 1806. The Prussian tax system was one of the most efficient in early modern Europe. Scholars have argued that (1) the Prussian tax administration was highly bureaucratic, and (2) its efficiency was due primarily to its bureaucratic characteristics. We challenge both propositions. We show that the Prussian tax system deviated from the bureaucratic ideal type in important respects. We then develop general propositions about the conditions under which bureaucratic forms of recruitment, monitoring, and sanctioning are more efficient than alternative forms of agency. We conclude that the efficiency of the Prussian tax collection system was caused by specific deviations from the ideal-typical bureaucracy that increased the ability of rulers to control tax officials.},

	Abstract = {This article presents information on R.H. Tawney, an economist. It is informed that the century from 1540 to 1640 may be defined as "Tawney's century." It is informed that Tawney's century was framed by two revolutions in church and state which also had enormous implications for society and the economy. Tawney was concerned very largely with changes in land-holding and commercial attitudes; the taking of interest and the decline of traditional Christian commercial teaching, the growth of capitalist farming, the exploitation or eviction of tenants and the destruction of whole villages by sheepmasters--and some of these can no longer be fitted happily into the chronology he proposed. It is informed that there is increasing evidence for nuclear families, a mobile population, and a cash economy much earlier than used to be thought, and "the rise of individualism" has been traced to "at least the thirteenth century."

	Abstract = { The lack of sustained growth in poor countries has often been attributed to 'fiscal weakness'. Empirical evidence suggests that governments often fail to provide crucial public goods. I argue that this failure may be the result of a political instability effect: more resources fuel power struggles among competing elites - and decrease the incumbent regime's time horizon in office. But with a shorter time horizon, it is less attractive to finance growth-promoting institutions whose returns only accrue in the future. The model further predicts the instability effect to be stronger in countries with little capital or in remote places which render technology adoption expensive. Copyright \&copy; The Author(s).

To solve the problem of corruption, the Ottomans implemented a variety of mechanisms, including periodic rotation of officials, separation of adjudication from punishment, and compensation for law enforcers through a two-part scheme consisting of fines and taxes. The system underwent a significant transformation after the seventeenth century, following a period of high inflation that raised the agency cost of a fixed fine system. Imperial decentralization in the provinces and the institution of long-term taxfarming also altered the government{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s relationship with local law enforcement agents and reduced the effectiveness of control mechanisms. Consequently, the Ottomans relied less on fines for punishment. Using insights from the law and economics literature, we examine how the earlier mechanisms helped to combat corruption in law enforcement and why they were less effective in later periods.},

@article{Leeson07e,
	Abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

We extend their framework by allowing employment to vary over time, at equidistant intervals. When both parties can precommit ex ante not to renogotiate the contract, this replicates the Grossman-Hart outcome each subperiod. When precommitment is not possible, information revealed through the contract can create Pareto improving renegotiation opportunities, and the issue of optimal information revelation arises. The paper analyzes the impact of ex post Pareto-improving renegotiations on the optimal contract.},

@article{Cramsie00,
	Abstract = {Financing the crown was, perhaps, the seminal question in the English reign of James VI and I. Attempts to tap commercial wealth were a central feature of fiscal policy. The derivations of crown finance from commerce are straightforward; for instance, customs duties or concessions the crown held in monopolies and patents. The grandest project of James's reign, Alderman Cockayne's project to export dyed and dressed cloth, embodied these commercial-fiscal connections in addition to the goal of economic growth. The same points are exemplified by proposals to construct a fleet of fishing vessels (busses) with which to confront Dutch mastery of the trade. This project also enticed policy-makers and provides a vehicle through which to examine the relationship between crown finance and commerce, the revisionist approach to the structural failures of early Stuart government, and the politics of crown finance. The first section will trace the development of `projects' and the conceptualization of crown finance as a project par excellence. The second section analyses specifically the busses projects. The final section examines the interaction of busses and fiscal policy in the 1610s. The argument is that the ultimate failure of finance was political rather than structural and the basis for this failure lay in the operation of Jacobean kingship upon policy-making.},

	Abstract = {This paper analyzes the choice of contractual forms in tax collection activities.It draws on historical data from the world as a whole to illustrate the factors involved in the choice among wage, share and fixed rent (tax farming) techniques. It also provides a detailed analysis of tax farming as applied to Tunisia's periodic markets so as to explain the continued reliance on this otherwise generally abandoned form of tax collection in this particular sector.Finally, some implications for policy in both developed and developing countries are derived. In diesem Artikel wird die Wahl zwischen unterschiedlichen Vertragsformen fur den Steuereinzug analysiert. Es wird dabei Gebrauch gemacht von historischen Begebenheiten auf der ganzen Welt, um die Fakten zu beleuchten, die bei der Wahl zwischen Lohn-, Anteils-und Festbetragsregelung involviert sind. Des weiteren enth{\"a}lt der Artikel eine detaillierte Analyse der Festbetragsregelung auf Tunesiens Wochenmarkten, um damit das andauernde Festhalten an einer andernorts im allgemeinen abgeschafften Art der Steuererhebung auf diesem speziellen Sektor zu erklaren.AbschlieBendwerdeneinige.SchluBfolgerungen fur die Politik sowohl in entwickelten als auch in unterentwickelten Lander gezogen.},

	Abstract = {We use book translations as a new measure of international idea flows and study the effects of Communism{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s collapse in Eastern Europe on these flows. Using novel data on 800,000 translations, we show that while translations between Communist languages decreased by two thirds with the collapse, Western-to-Communist translations increased by a factor of seven and reached Western levels. Convergence was full in economically-beneficial fields such as sciences and only partial in culturally-beneficial fields such as history. The effects were larger for more Western-oriented countries. These findings help us understand how institutions shape the international diffusion of knowledge. Creation Date: 2010-08 Revision Date:},

	Abstract = { We use individual-level survey and county-level expenditure data to examine the extent to which Hanukkah celebrations among US Jews are driven by the presence of Christmas. We document that Jews with young children are more likely to celebrate Hanukkah, that this effect is greater for reform Jews and for strongly-identified Jews, and that Jewish-related expenditure on Hanukkah is higher in counties with lower shares of Jews. All these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that celebration of religious holidays is designed not only for worship and enjoyment but also to provide a counterbalance for children against competing cultural influences.

	Abstract = {It is conventionally assumed that the pre-modern working year was fixed and that consumption varied with changes in wages and prices. This is challenged by the twin theories of the {\^a}€˜industrious{\^a}€{\texttrademark} revolution and the consumer revolution, positing a longer working year as people earned surplus money to buy novel goods. In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we use a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the working year of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that. By comparing with independent estimates of the actual working year, we find two {\^a}€˜industrious{\^a}€{\texttrademark} revolutions among rural workers; both, however, are attributable to economic hardship, and we detect no signs of a consumer revolution. For urban labourers, by contrast, a growing gap between their actual working year and the work required to buy the basket provides great scope for a consumer revolution.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the distribution of government revenue, and the burden on the economy posed by taxation, in the light of recent debates about the role of demand, the 'crowding-out' effects of war, and the timing of the industrial revolution. An analysis of the burden in terms of real per caput income and in terms of the taxpayer, suggests that taxation may well have exercised negative effects on the economy by slowing down the pace of industrialization from the point of view of home demand. An attempt is made to rejuvenate the debate on the role of taxation as a vital influence on economic development. However, in diverting funds out of consumption successive governments in the eighteenth century used them instead to help finance wars. Undoubtedly there was a leakage back to war- induced demand, but it is just as likely that the main effect of wars was to secure markets and sources of raw materials overseas for future use. The immediate effect may have been to crowd out the industrial revolution, but in the longer term it probably made the industrial revolution more secure.},

	Abstract = {The book brings together a series of research papers presented at the conference on \&quot;The Mezzogiorno and regional policies\&quot;, held in Perugia on 26-27 February 2009. The analyses refer to various aspects of the regional economies: wages, bargaining and prices; environmental diseconomies; public capital and competitiveness; disparities in European regions and other countries' experiences; households' financial choices and the difficulties firms face in the South of Italy; and regional policies and federalism. Together with other research, some of the analyses contained in the book provided basic material for the conference on \&quot;The Mezzogiorno and economic policy in Italy\&quot; (Rome, 26 November 2009).},

@article{Carlos92,
	Abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

	Abstract = {Medieval historians have long maintained that social welfare in the com munities of rural England often involved private systems of
support
for the elderly. Individuallv arranged pension plans provide a case in point. The best evidence of these pension plans is found in the records of
manor
courts. To read the records is to learn how pension plans enabled the elderly to adjust their needs to local patterns of production and domestic
structure, to law, to expressions of personal autonomy. and the confines of personal dependency. Simply stated, the old ac commodated their needs for
support by looking to benefactors to manage their lands and tenements. The subsequent arrangement involved a contractual agree ment designed both to
ensure and to supplement familial support, and also, under certain circumstances, to provide a substitute for it. As a result, not even peasants
without children or spouses necessarily experienced dislocation. Contracts assured cooperation. They afforded the partners a way to negotiate mutually
beneficial bargains wherein the conditional transfer of property was meant to guarantee securitv during retirement.

	Abstract = {The new economic sociology contends that personal relationships and trust play key roles in structuring economic activity. Max Weber's
1906
essay, `Churches and Sects,' epitomizes the new economic sociology argument. The piece not only details the origins of and individual motivations
behind social capital formation in sects, it also shows how congregation--based social capital facilitated the emergence of capitalism in America. I
supplement Weber's work with that of contemporary scholars to provide social--capital--based explanations of capitalism in northern Italy, the
Netherlands, and England, all emphasizing the significance of credit.

	Abstract = { We present a model in which individuals' preferences are defined over their consumption, transfers to offspring, and social status associated with income. We show that a separating equilibrium exists where individuals' expenditure on conspicuous consumption is a signal for their unobserved income. In this equilibrium, poor families that climb up the social ladder by the accumulation of wealth engage in conspicuous consumption that prevents them from escaping poverty. Our model may explain why the poor make some choices that do not appear to help them escape poverty. (JEL: D91, O11, O12, O15) (c) 2010 by the European Economic Association.},

Surprisingly, the crown s revenues increased. I present a transaction cost argument to explain the behavior of tax farm lease prices as tax farming changed during the seventeenth century. Cartelization of tax farms lowered costs faced by the crown. The tax farm system s evolution offers insights into how organizations evolve to protect their property rights in the absence of well functioning representative institutions.},

Feinstein{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s historical national accounts for the UK developed out of this project and built on its earlier contributions. He was the foremost constructor of historical accounts in the UK, and shared with other national accounting pioneers a pragmatic approach and a bias against neo-classical general equilibrium. He made important contributions to growth accounting and the measurement of standards of living, and also left his mark as a teacher and as an academic leader. His commitment to racial equality in South Africa preceded his academic career, and continued after his formal retirement.},

In a field experiment using university students, we find that subjects who have been incentivized to exercise increase gym usage more if they have more treated friends. However, control subjects are not influenced by their peers. Findings demonstrate that fraction treated has a large influence on outcomes in this environment, and spillovers vary greatly by treatment status. Results highlight subtle effects of randomization and document a low-cost method for improving the generalizability of controlled interventions in networked environments.},

	Abstract = {Separated sets of concepts and procedures have developed from studies on the religious and ethnic identifications of Christians and Jews. This article strives to integrate these research streams through a set of eight identification dimensions. Using prior research by Lenski and Sklare, these eight dimensions are formed into two path analysis models-one for Protestants and one for Jews. These models are then evaluated by data from a probability sample of Chicago area Jews and white Protestants. As would be expected, findings only partially support the hypothesized path models. The data indicate that there is a mainstream of identification that runs from childhood home religious background to religious education to religious behavior to activity in ethnic organizations and to concern over one's children's religious education. Lenski's finding that ethnic community life and religious institutions were somewhat separated is supported for Protestants, but not for Jews. These eight identity dimensions are controlled for two recursive blocks of biosocial and socioeconomic variables and are related to general community organization activities, anomie, and a measure of liberalness. The findings for high-moderate status Jews show weak or negative relations between identification measures and liberalness. Low-status Jews show positive relations between five dimensions and liberalness. Protestants display weak relations between their identity dimensions and liberalness with no evidence of an interaction with social status. Finally, two new identity models are presented for further empirical testing.},

@article{Lazerwitz79,
	Abstract = {This paper furthers our understanding of American religious pluralism by analyzing Jewish denominational patterns as revealed by data from the National Jewish Population Survey. A clear ranking among the denominational subgroups emerges, ranging from those identifying with Orthodoxy, to those identifying with Conservative Judaism, Reform, and finally those having no denominational preferences. This last group has the lowest levels of religious and ethnic identification. The subgroups closer to the Orthodox pole have higher levels of Jewish identification and observance, and are somewhat lower in socioeconomic status and voluntary association activities. The socioeconomic differences are considerably smaller than they are known to have been historically, but differences in the degree of Americanization, as indicated by the number of generations in the United States, remain strong. The data also show that marital patterns and certain secular attitudes and behavior are associated with denominational identification and synagogue membership. Analogies are suggested between the ideological and behavioral divisions within American Judaism and those found in Protestantism. Our findings point to the durability of a denominationalism which is becoming increasingly independent of its classic social and economic sources.},

@article{Leeson07a,
	Abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

	Abstract = {Abstract I offer an explanation for the coexistence of joint-liability and individual-liability microcredit contracts. I show that both contracts maximize welfare when credit is rationed due to limited liability, but for different borrowers. Borrowers monitor each other when liability is joint, while the lender monitors individual loans. Joint liability offers poorer borrowers larger loans with less monitoring effort than would have to be exerted by the lender. Individual liability offers the wealthier among credit-constrained borrowers larger loans even without monitoring. The theory explains why individual loans serve the wealthier among poor borrowers and are larger, and why businesses funded with individual loans grow more.},

	Abstract = {There is a counterintuitive gap in the club theory of religion. While it elegantly accounts for the notable success of strict sectarian religious groups in recruiting members and maintaining commitment, it exhibits less satisfactory properties when used to account for groups requiring neither extreme nor zero sacrifice. Such corner solutions, compared to the moderate middle, are rarely observed empirically. Within the original representative agent model, moderate groups are everywhere and always a suboptimal choice for rational, utility maximizing agents. In this paper, we extend the original model to operate within a multi-agent computational context, with heterogeneous agents occupying coordinates in a two dimensional lattice, making repeated decisions over time. Our model offers the possibility of successful moderate groups, including outcomes wherein the population is dominated by moderate groups. The viability of moderate groups is a result of heterogeneous agent wages. Lower wage agents offer greater time contributions, but lesser financial contributions to groups. Higher sacrifice rates incentive greater contributions from members, but reduce private productivity and screen out other potential members with greater financial resources. Moderate groups succeed by offering an optimal balance of these countervailing forces.},

	Abstract = { Economic growth has not led to a decline in religion despite past predictions that it would. Using a formal model of religious competition, I show how economic growth produces counteracting effects on religious activity in an open religious market, and that it has little effect in a religious market that is already secularized due to regulations that prohibit religious competition or in a highly religious market with regulations that inhibit secular activities. Theories predicting the decline of religion due to rising opportunity costs of religious demand and supply ignore countervailing influences.

	Abstract = {The renown or infamy of Henry VIII's Great Debasement (1542 - 1553), which the government of his successor, Edward VI, continued for another six years after his death, has unfairly obscured his earlier and far more modest coinage changes and public-spirited monetary policies. Furthermore, despite the renown of and the ample literature devoted to the Great Debasement this unusual episode in early-modern monetary history still lacks a fully accurate exposition and explanation. For example, did it begin in 1542 or 1544? How did it work, and why and how did it prove to be successful or profitable'. This study seeks to provide such an accurate exposition and explanation, and thus to provide a proper contrast with Henry VIII's earlier coinage changes and monetary policies while also providing a brief comparison with those of Edward IV, whose debasements of 1464-65 were the last undertaken before those of Henry VIII. The subject of coinage debasements remains an arcane subject, ill understood not only by students of European history but also by many of the historians and economists who have published on topics in monetary history. A major problem is that historians have not clearly asked one fundamental question: were debasements fundamentally aggressive or defensive in nature? The second question to be asked is the nature of the goals sought from debasement: were they fundamentally monetary or fiscal? The fiscal aspect of coinage debasements is derived from the fact that in pre-modern western Europe minting was a princely or government monopoly from which the prince or government derived a fee known as seigniorage. The central thesis of this study is that aggressive' coinage debasements were undertaken primarily as fiscal policies to increase mint profits: profits from an increased mint output and from a increased seigniorage rate. In most, of not all cases, the fiscal motive was to finance warfare, even if indirectly. As this study shows, aggressive coinage debasements w},

@article{Nye07b,
	Abstract = {From the late 1600s to the mid 1800s, Britain was able to transform from a divided kingdom with a fragmented, often stagnant economy into a powerful and stable state that simultaneously saw an expansion in the power, wealth, and stability of the central government while encouraging an economic transformation that gradually allowed both industrial technology and liberal commerce to flourish and break out of its mercantilist straitjacket. We explain how rent-seeking elites who might normally have opposed such sweeping transformations promoted institutional changes that, in the long run, expanded the economy and encouraged innovation even at the expense of class interests. In the short run, this meant that rent-seeking in the 18th century was not so much reduced as redirected from local monopolies to state authorities and Parliament. But in the longer run, the process of professionalization made possible greater liberalism in general, even at the expense of general rent-seeking itself. The position of Parliament as a meta-institution for reforming and weakening rent-creating restrictions as needed was pivotal to this process. Ideological changes{\^a}€''particularly the Scottish enlightenment{\^a}€''transformed the terms of the debate but could only be operationalized once interests were aligned so that gainers from industrialization could compensate or overcome traditional interests.},

@article{Pammer98,
	Abstract = { This article examines private Austrian investment in the Hungarian economy as an example of private financial investment in a backward foreign economy in the late nineteenth century. The main finding is the dominant role of Austrian investment in institutional securities such as Hungarian state bonds and bank securities, which comprised a steadily rising proportion in the portfolios of investors. The only other important sector of the Hungarian economy that was invested in directly was the transport system, which depended on the fluctuations in the development of the Hungarian economy rather than on long-term trends. Securities of the manufacturing sector did not attract the interest of most Austrian investors. Banks and the state thus constituted an element of stability in the Hungarian economy and helped it to acquire funds that could not be provided by the domestic market.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a survey on studies that analyze the macroeconomic effects of intellectual property rights (IPR). The first part of this paper introduces different patent policy instruments and reviews their effects on R\&D and economic growth. This part also discusses the distortionary effects and distributional consequences of IPR protection as well as empirical evidence on the effects of patent rights. Then, the second part considers the international aspects of IPR protection. In summary, this paper draws the following conclusions from the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments have different effects on R\&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality. Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level of protection requires an international coordination (rather than the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

@article{Taylor09b,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the 100-fold increase in reserve balances at the Federal Reserve during 2008. By looking at the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and factors influencing the supply and demand for reserves, the paper shows that the increase was due to large purchases of securities and loans to certain sectors and institutions. Such actions constitute a combination of monetary policy and industrial policy, or a mondustrial policy. This characterization raises questions about the future of the Federal Reserve and suggests the need to return to a monetary framework that controls the money supply while the interest rate is zero and establishes rules for setting the interest rate.Business Economics (2009) 44, 63\&ndash;72. doi:10.1057/be.2009.1},

   U.S. states. We improve on existing studies of the cost of corruption
   by using a better specified empirical model, focusing on a study
   population that is less likely to be affected by parameter
   heterogeneity, and controlling for endogeneity using political
   variables to instrument for corruption. We find that corruption plays a
   significant and causal role in lowering growth and investment across

@article{OBrien88,
	Abstract = {Between 1660 and 1815 the British government managed to appropriate extraordinary and ever increasing amounts of revenue without much difficulty and without provoking tax revolts. Its success owed something to economic growth, which widened and deepened the base for taxation, but far more to an efficient and politically acceptable selection of the commodities and social groups imposed upon to carry the fiscal burden of its expansionary foreign and military policies. Despite the antipathy they arouse, foreign and military policies. Despite the antipathy they aroused, for administrative and political reasons excises and stamp duties imposed on goods and services produced and sold within the kingdom made the greatest long-term contribution towards Britain's rise to the status of a great power. Even at times of pressing military necessity taxes collected by the central government of an aristocratic state did not become manifestly more regressive. And with the introduction of an income tax during the long war with Revolutionary France their incidence probably shifted in a progressive direction.},

@article{Bever02,
	Abstract = {While a strong consensus has emerged in the last generation about many sociocultural aspects of witchcraft, the role of gender--why witchcraft was particularly but not exclusively associated with women--has remained problematic. This article asserts that women in early modern Europe were thought more likely to be witches because, the evidence suggests, they were in fact more likely to act like witches. Hostility and violence figured prominently in early modern village and small town life, and women resorted to witch-like behaviors ranging from premeditated poisoning and surreptitious assault through ritual malefic magic to spontaneous displays of intense anger because these were effective means of engaging in conflicts that played to their learned and innate strengths while avoiding forms of struggle they were less well equipped for. The article concludes by suggesting that the intervention of the state in the form of widespread and protracted witch prosecutions played a role in inhibiting witch-like practices and behaviors, and since these were utilized far more often by women than men, helped change the perceived "nature" of women from the Medieval notion that they were particularly violent and lustful to the modern image of women as gentle and asexual.},
